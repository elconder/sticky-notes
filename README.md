For this exercise, you will be rapidly developing a front-end prototype (HTML,JavaScript, CSS) for a brand new sticky note application. Functionality should include:

* The ability to create and display one or more yellow sticky notes on the page
* The ability to drag and drop sticky notes anywhere on the page
* The ability to open sticky note:
  * When user clicks on the sticky note, it will have a “flip over” animation
  * As it flips over, the sticky note will animate to the front of the UI in one seamless motion, similar to a modal window
  * The flipped sticky note will come to rest at the vertical and horizontal centers ofthe page
* The backside of the sticky note will be blue
* The ability to close an open sticky note:
  * When a user closes a sticky note, it will have a “flip back over” animation
  * As the sticky note flips back over to the yellow side, it will animate back to theexact position on the page where it was originally located before it was clicked
